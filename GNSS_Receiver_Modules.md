## About
Here are some notes about different GNSS modules that I've played around with. The inspiration for this effort is [@morrownr](https://github.com/morrownr)'s [USB-WiFi github site](https://github.com/morrownr/USB-WiFi), which has become the holy document for which Wi-Fi adapters are supported well in Linux.
